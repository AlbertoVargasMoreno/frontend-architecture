# About this SPA

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project's root directory:
```bash
cd pokemonSPA/
```

2. Once you're in the project's root directory, you need to start a web server.

   JavaScript [modules] need to be tested through a server. If you simply open the `index.html` file by clicking or opening it directly in your browser, the JavaScript modules won't load successfully. Here's an option using PHP, but you can also achieve this with Python or Node.js:

```bash
$ pokemonSPA/ (master)
php -S localhost:8000
```
